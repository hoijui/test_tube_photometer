## Welcome!

This will be filled with more information at a later point.
You can find a description on how to build the OLD VERSION of the photometer [here](https://alexanderkutschera.com/2017/12/09/photometer-shopping-list.html).

### Background
#### What's a photometer?
Photometers are used to measure light extinction in liquids to analyse their content. They basically shine light through a certain amount of the liquid from one side and measure the light that's left on the other side. Among other things, photometers are used to measure the densities of bacterial cultures on a regular basis. You can determine them by comparing photometer measurements of culture media with (sample value) and without bacteria (blank value). Using physical laws you can then calculate the optical density of your sample.

#### Why a test tube photometer?
Well, I'm a lazy person. In order to measure the optical density of my bacterial cultures I always had to take a sample from them. This usually meant I had to work sterile to avoid contamination of my cultures which is a bit time consuming. That's why I asked myself if there is a way to measure the density directly in the test tube without having to open it. There are already some test tube photometer out there but they are expensive and often require the use of specific test tubes. That's why I started to develop a photometer which I could use with the standard test tubes.
